## Overview

This is a React-based movie application that allows users to browse and explore information about movies. It provides features like viewing popular movies, movie details, bookmarks, and more. Users can mark movies as favorites and access detailed information about each movie, including ratings, descriptions, and production companies.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router:** Used for handling client-side routing and navigation within the application.
- **API Integration:** Fetches movie data from an external API (e.g., The Movie Database) using HTTP requests.
- **Skeleton Loading:** Provides a loading skeleton UI while data is being fetched.
- **FontAwesome:** Utilized for icons used throughout the application.

## Configuration

To use this application with external movie data, you will need an API key. You can obtain an API key from a movie database service like [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Once you have your API key, replace the placeholder API key in the codebase with your own.

```javascript
// Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```
